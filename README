Dist-Zilla-Plugin-VersionFromScript
===================================

This is a plugin to generalize Dist::Zilla's concept of a version number.
In your dist.ini file, add lines like:

; get version from number of Git logs
[VersionFromScript]
script = git-logs2version.pl

The script can be any script or program that prints a version-type number
(which will be used as the release version number) to STDOUT.

Included in this package are two scripts for generating versions from
Subversion (svnversion.pl) and Git (git-logs2version.pl).  These scripts
can take arguments of:

    --major  2      # add a major revision number
    --offset 35     # adds offset to the minor revision

So for example, if you are at revision 50, calling

    script = svnversion.pl --major 3 --offset 35

produces 3.085 as the version number.
